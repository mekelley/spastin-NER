1) Image spastin or CHMP4B expressing cells as per LiveImagingFlpIn_20190329.doc protocol
2) Organize image files into folders by cell type and then treatment (ex. HeLa/DMSO/*image files*)
3) Run Cyto_20200225.ijm in FIJI to evaluate the cytoplasmic background/expression of construct
4) Run ComDetAnalysisMaxIP_20200226.ijm in FIJI to calculate number of foci per frame (change parameters as indicated in code based on whether cells express spastin or CHMP4B)
