1) Image cells expressing fluorescently labeled tubulin and fluorescently labeled spastin
2) Track spastin foci from hyperstacks (x,y,z,t) using FIJI Trackmate
3) Run Channel_Split.ijm in FIJI to separate hyperstacks by channel
4) Run MeasureTubulinAndSpastinTracks_20200727_v2.m in MATLAB to manually categorize spastin foci as kinetochore/midzone associated and determine whether tubulin is proximal
5) Organize saved MATLAB data files into folders by treatment conditions
6) Run LoopingTubSpastTracks_20201130.m in MATLAB to combine data from multiple cells per condition
