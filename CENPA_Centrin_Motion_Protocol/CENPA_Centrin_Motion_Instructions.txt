1) Image cells as per LiveImagingCENPcen_20201216.doc protocol
2) Track CENPA/centrin foci from hyperstacks (x,y,z,t) using FIJI Trackmate
3) Delete any extraneous tracks (if two tracks are present for the centrosome, delete the shortest track)
4) Save the SPOTS data as a csv file
5) Organize csv files into folders by treatment conditions
6) For each csv file, run xyzCenpTrack_v6.m to calculate pole separation and kinetochore to pole movements (matlab data is saved to source folder for csv file)
7) Run LoopingMeanCurves_CENP_20210206.m on source folder (organized by treatment conditions) for matlab files to calculate averages for given condition
